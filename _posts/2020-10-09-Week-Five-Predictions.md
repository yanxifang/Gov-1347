## Week 5 Analysis: Productive Investment or Marketing Ploy? Evaluating the Role of Advertising
*Friday, October 9, 2020*

Advertising has sometimes been cited as important for a candidate's success in U.S. presidential elections. A few that I've seen prior to taking Gov 1347 include the ["Morning in America" ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/the-ad-that-helped-reagan-sell-good-times-to-an-uncertain-nation.html) (Reagan, 1984), the ["Daisy" ad](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-daisy-ad-changed-everything-about-political-advertising-180958741/) (Johnson, 1964), and the [infamous Willie Horton ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/politics/bush-willie-horton.html) (Bush, 1988). This week, I will analyze the impact of advertising on outcomes, and then add "advertising spending" as one of the predictors in my ongoing model for 2020.

## Assumptions & Theoretical Background


When including advertising as a variable in my model, **a key assumption is that there are differences between campaigns.** This is not always the case: for example, fundamentals-only models are based on the assumption that only the existence - not the activities - of a campaign matters, since campaign efforts on both sides will balance out over the course of the months leading up to the election. 

## Visualizing the Data: Size of Advertising Campaigns
Something interesting to analyze is the size of advertising campaigns, as measured by cost. If advertising is as important as it is often considered to be, then "desperate" candidates - i.e. those from the party that is not currently in office - should be spending more on advertisements than their opponent, in the hope that the advertisements will convince Data is only available for the 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 elections, but since advertising is done at the local level, there are many rows of data to consider. Below, I have created histograms showing the number of advertising campaigns by size (dollar amount) and party.
