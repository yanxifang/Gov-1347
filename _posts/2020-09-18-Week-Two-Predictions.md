## Week 2 Analysis: Economic Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 18, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing the impact of economic conditions on election results. I will mainly use GDP and unemployment data as two proxies for prevailing economic conditions at the national level, and for a more detailed analysis, I will look at state-level unemployment data to determine if more localized economic factors have impacts on a state's choice of presidential party or candidate.

### Assumptions and Theoretical Background
**Using economic data to predict elections is rooted in the assumption of "pocketbook voting", where voters make decisions based on their evaluations of the economy.** If voters do not actually consider the economy as they enter the voting booth, this analysis wouldn't be meaningful at all. Fortunately, there is much literature about the role of the economy in U.S. presidential elections. For example, [Achen and Bartels (2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q) argue that while voters tend to respond to economic changes, the incumbent president generally has little control over the economy. Moreover, they argue that voters hold unrealistic time horizons, significantly discount economic performance in the earlier part of an incumbent's term, and have difficulty distinguishing the economic changes that occur between different leaders. This argument is similar to that expressed by [Healy and Lenz (2014)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24363467) about election-year economics and the potential of adversely selecting a president that is good at economic manipulation.
