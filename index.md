Welcome to my election analysis blog for Government 1347 (Election Analytics) at Harvard University!

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Yanxi Fang, an undergraduate student at Harvard University majoring in Government with a minor in Economics. This blog presents my work for Gov 1347, a course that I am taking during the Fall 2020 semester. Over the course of the semester, I will be updating the blog every Friday with new data, models, predictions, or visualizations. Please note that any opinions expressed on this page are mine only, and do not express the views or opinions of any other entity.
