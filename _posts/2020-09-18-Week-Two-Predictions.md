This week, I am analyzing the impact of economic conditions on election results. I will mainly use GDP and unemployment data as two proxies for prevailing economic conditions at the national level, and for a more detailed analysis, I will look at state-level unemployment data to determine if more localized economic factors have impacts on a state's choice of presidential party or candidate.

**National Level GDP Data**

**National Level Unemployment Data**

**State Level Unemployment Data**

**Implications & Conclusions**
