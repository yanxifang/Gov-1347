## Week 1 Analysis: Historical Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 11, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing historical election results from 1948 to 2016. Since all predictions are based on events that have occurred in the past, analyzing the past is a good start for the blog. I will first explore the national-level results before shifting to results from individual states; after all, the Electoral College system makes certain swing states quite important for determining the national winner.

### National-Level Data
To start, I will use the some of the simplest data possible: the two-party vote share in past elections. As shown below, there have been many fluctuations in the vote share between the two major parties, suggesting that presidential elections in the United States have been quite competitive, at least for the past 70 years.

While this trend may seem intuitive given that the country has had both Democratic and Republican presidents in the recent past, the very fact that elections are competitive does have profound consequences. For example, the Enos and Hersh (2017) piece about closeness indicates that the closer that campaign operatives (and campaigns more generally) think an election will be, the more likely that they will change tactics and/or make stronger efforts to appeal to target voters. This, of course, affects policies and other candidate actions, which would in turn change the validity of existing predictions.

Another way that closeness matters is with voters themselves: as described in the Westwood (2020) reading about probabilistic forecasts, a sizeable bloc of voters are strategic, meaning that they will vote only if they believe that their vote will make a difference. Since voter turnout in the United States is quite low (according to the Pew Research Center, [only 56% in the 2016 presidential election](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/)), the electoral map could look very different if citizens who rarely vote (or have never voted) start to vote regularly in presidential or other federal-level elections. In other words, if closeness is actually a significant motivator for voters, the current two-party vote share pattern could change radically. Again, these changes would disrupt the existing models and predictions.

However, it is important to note that the data that this analysis is based upon does have a flaw: because of the Electoral College, receiving a majority of votes does not imply victory in the election. Furthermore, the popular vote percentages are not always accurate indications of closeness because electoral votes, which depend on state-level election results, are ultimately the deciding factor in determining the winner of a presidential election, *not* the popular vote. Nonetheless, the data still holds relevance because the prediction/polling information available to the general public typically consists of popular vote percentages rather than Electoral College vote projections.
