## Week 1 Analysis: Historical Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 11, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing historical election results from 1948 to 2016. Since all predictions are based on events that have occurred in the past, this is a good start to the blog. I will first explore the national-level results, and then analyze results from individual states - both over the time period of 1948-2016.

### National-Level Data
To start, I will use the simplest data possible: the two-party vote share in past elections. As shown below, there is significant fluctuation over time in the vote share between the two major parties, suggesting that presidential elections in the United States have been quite competitive in the past. While this trend may seem intuitive given the country's many previous peaceful transitions of power, the fact that elections are competitive can have profound consequences.

In particular, the Enos and Hersh (2017) piece about closeness indicates that the closer that a prospective voter thinks an election will be, the more likely that they will actually cast a ballot. Because voter turnout in the United States is quite low at [around 56% (for the 2016 presidential election)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/), particularly in comparison to other Western democracies, the electoral map could look very different if citizens who rarely vote (or have never voted) start to vote regularly in presidential or other federal-level elections. In other words, if we accept Enos and Hersh's concept that closeness is a motivating factor for voter participation, then the current two-party vote share pattern could change radically - changes that would completely disrupt modeling/predictions.

Although this analysis can seem profound, the data that it is based upon does have a limitation: due to the Electoral College system, receiving a majority of votes does not imply victory in the election. Furthermore, the popular vote percentages are not always accurate indications of closeness, because electoral votes, which depend on state-level election results, are ultimately the deciding factor in determining the winner of a presidential election - in other words, the closeness of electoral votes is likely different from the closeness of the popular vote percentages). Nonetheless, the data is still useful, particularly with a closeness lens, because polling information available to the general public typically consists of popular vote percentage projections rather than Electoral College vote projections.

This is a graphic showing the two-party popular vote share in past elections:
