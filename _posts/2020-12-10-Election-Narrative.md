## Testing an Election Narrative: Cindy McCain and the Democratic Victory in Arizona
*Thursday, December 10, 2020*

## Introduction
**The state of Arizona has not voted for a Democrat [since Bill Clinton in 1996](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-arizona-became-a-swing-state/). Yet, it voted for Democrat Joe Biden [this year](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-mark-kelly-6841e27210770f59418bdc13a60ccec7)**, taking 11 electoral votes away from incumbent Donald Trump. The media, including [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cindy-mccain-arizona-election-biden-trump/2020/11/16/f4f29be4-2850-11eb-92b7-6ef17b3fe3b4_story.html), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/john-mccain-arizonas-gop-defeat-donald-trump-434913), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/opinions/joe-biden-flips-arizona-election-2020-talton/index.html), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/524420-former-mccain-adviser-says-biden-flipping-arizona-was-revenge-of-john), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/932091586/three-big-reasons-why-biden-is-expected-to-win-arizona), and more, have partly attributed this election upset to Cindy McCain, the widow of long-serving Republican Sen. John McCain. This year, McCain has not only taken the rare step of [speaking at the DNC](https://apnews.com/article/2ab413939e3747215da2c34dcbd323cf), but also personally [endorsed Joe Biden](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/politics/joe-biden-cindy-mccain-endorse/index.html) for the presidency, crossing party lines in a rebuke of President Trump.

**The narrative argues that Cindy McCain leveraged the late Senator McCain's popularity among both Republicans and moderates in Arizona to swing critical votes toward Biden**, contributing to the Democratic victory in the state. While McCain's defiance of the Republican Party may seem surprising, it was certainty no more unusual than the tensions between Trump and the senator. In July 2015, then-presidential candidate Trump [said](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/18/424169549/trump-lashes-out-at-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured) "I like people who weren't captured," referring to the fact that Sen. McCain was [captured  as a prisoner of war](https://time.com/5377698/john-mccain-prisoner-of-war-vietnam/) during the Vietnam War. Tensions between Trump and McCain [rose](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/08/24/mccain-trump-feud-running-list-clashes-snubs-and-conflicts/1089090002/) over the course of the 2016 election cycle, and [continued](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45313845) after he became president in 2017. The divide between the two men became most evident after McCain's death in 2018, when Trump was [explicitly disinvited](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/politics/mccain-funeral-trump.html) from McCain's state funeral despite his role as the sitting president *of the same political party*.

This is important to consider not only because McCain herself has [taken credit](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/cindy-mccain-john-mccain-pleased-biden-win-cnntv/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_source=fbCNN&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2020-11-10T09%3A30%3A22) for the victory (and is [under consideration](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/527814-biden-eyeing-cindy-mccain-for-uk-ambassador-position-report) to be Biden's ambassador to the UK), but also because **it explains an important phenomenon that could have implications for the future: whether Arizona becoming blue is a temporary or long-term change.** If McCain's endorsement was not too significant, then one would expect Arizona to continue voting Democratic in future presidential elections. In contrast, if McCain's influence was indeed significant, then it is likely that Arizona will become red again in 2024 (assuming that Trump does not seek the presidency or is unsuccessful in becoming the Republican nominee) and beyond. There are several alternative explanations for Arizona's choice of Joe Biden as president, which mainly fall under two categories: demographics and other fundamentals. 

**The testable implication is that demographic changes and the economy, which are predictable and observable (respectively), don't matter as much as an "October surprise"-type shock (i.e. McCain's endorsement of Biden),** at least in Arizona. This is important in the context of the other variables that influence elections because if such surprises have a strong impact on election outcomes, then the early forecasting would be essentially useless: surprises are, by default, impossible to predict in advance. Below, I will analyze some of the available data, including state-level polls, county-level vote outcomes, demographic data, and "fundamentals" data to see whether there's some quantitative evidence that is consistent with this "McCain theory" of Biden's win in Arizona.

## Polling
If McCain's endorsement of Biden did have an effect, **the most convincing indicator will come from state-level polling data** in the form of a bump in Biden support in the days after the endorsement ([September 22](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-arizona-john-mccain-cindy-mccain-joe-biden-6eea561a0fc235651ae6d01b64546492)). In my analysis, I used poll data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls-page/president_polls.csv), filtering for just Arizona and looking specifically at the narrow time range between Biden's victory in the Democratic primary ([June 5](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/05/869553801/biden-formally-secures-democratic-nomination-while-gaining-steam-against-trump)) and the day of the election, November 3. Below is the visualized data for Biden:

While the number of polls was not large at just 77 (which was expected, given that state-level polling is generally very expensive and time-consuming relative to the benefits that a candidate could reap), the resulting visual does seem interpretable. In particular, **the Biden poll data does *not* indicate a prolonged effect from McCain's endorsement**: while the poll percentages seem to increase significantly in the few days after the September 22 endorsement, they soon decreased and settled back at around the 47.5% range -- the same level as pre-endorsement -- within approximately a week. So, the polling results are inconsistent with the narrative that McCain's endorsement helped Biden carry Arizona.

To view another point of reference before coming to a final conclusion about polls, I also added Trump's poll data to the graph, resulting in the following visualization:

![Arizona Polls for Both Candidates](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1347/images/az_polls_all.png)

As seen above, Biden's increased support post-endorsement, which I previously dismissed as noise in the data, is actually correlated with Trump's decreased support post-endorsement. However, this does *not* change my conclusion: since the two men are the only viable candidates in the election, it makes intuitive sense that polls (or even a single poll) released on the same day will necessarily indicate a zero-sum game, where any gain by Biden must be matched by a similar (although not always identical) reduction in support for Trump. Also, even if I were to assume that there was some form of post-endorsement increase/decrease in support, the graph also shows the Trump poll level returning to a more stable level of around 44-45%, within a week after the endorsement. Furthermore, the stable levels for Trump stayed that way up until Election Day, although with a lot of noise/oscillations, serving as another indicator about McCain's lack of impact. Since the visual shows early September as the timeframe when polling support for both candidates stabilized, I can conclude that the *polling data, alone,* is simply not consistent with the claim of Cindy McCain's endorsement having a substantial impact on Arizona.

Furthermore, **there is a major problem with using the state-level polling data:** since polls do not continuously release results, and since there are not many polls active in the state, each data point on the graphs above likely represents the one and only poll released on the respective date. This means that the **day-to-day variations (and oscillations) seen in the data are more indicative of differences in the predictions of individual polls**, rather than of an actual, substantial change in public support. With this in mind, there is a natural alternative explanation for the spike in Biden support (and associated collapse in Trump support) following McCain's endorsement: that the poll released shortly thereafter was conducted by a firm with a record of favoring/over-predicting Democratic support, thus making the data less trustworthy. This is very much a possibility, and it only reinforces my earlier conclusion about the endorsement.

## Demographics
An alternative angle is demographics: while McCain's influence could have been significant in persuading moderates (and Republicans alienated by Trump) to vote for Biden instead, **demographics have also been cited as an important reason for the state flipping parties.** For example, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/13/934591289/how-the-navajo-nation-helped-flip-arizona-for-democrats) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-flagstaff-arizona-voting-rights-fa452fbd546fa00535679d78ac40b890) cite the role of the Navajo Nation in supporting Biden, while [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/years-making-established-latino-groups-helped-biden-arizona-nevada-n1246864) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/arizona-trump-biden/2020/11/07/9f64475a-1fb7-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html) point to the growing Latinx population as a reason for Arizona becoming more blue. These two demographic groups, overall, tend to vote for Democrats, which would imply that Cindy McCain's endorsement only added "noise" to Biden's victory.

For my analysis, I used data from the [American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States%20Race%20and%20Ethnicity&g=0400000US04,04.050000&tid=ACSDT5Y2019.B02001&moe=false&hidePreview=true), which is conducted annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. Since the term "Hispanic" is [not designated on government forms as an option under "race"](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/06/16/321819185/on-the-census-who-checks-hispanic-who-checks-white-and-why), causing many people who identify as Latinx to mark themselves as "white", I decided to focus exclusively on Indigenous / Native American populations instead. 

In addition to the Navajo Nation and Arizona's Latinx population, **there is also a sizeable group of politically independent and moderate voters in Arizona.** These are the people that McCain has claimed credit for, given that Sen. McCain was often amenable to bipartisanship and compromise during his time in office.
