## Week 1 Analysis: Historical Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 11, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing historical election results from 1948 to 2016. Since all predictions are based on events that have occurred in the past, analyzing the past is a good start for the blog. I will first explore the national-level results before shifting to results from individual states. Both are important: while national-level results ultimately determine the winner, the Electoral College system also makes it possible for a candidate who has won key "swing" states to win nationally without receiving an overall majority.

### National-Level Data
To start, I will use the some of the simplest data possible: the two-party vote share in past elections. As shown below, there have been many fluctuations in the vote share between the two major parties, suggesting that presidential elections in the United States have been quite competitive, at least for the past 70 years.

While this trend may seem intuitive given that the country has had both Democratic and Republican presidents in the recent past, the very fact that elections are competitive does have profound consequences. For example, the Enos and Hersh (2017) piece about closeness indicates that the closer that campaign operatives (and campaigns more generally) think an election will be, the more likely that they will change tactics and/or make stronger efforts to appeal to target voters. This, of course, affects policies and other candidate actions, which would in turn change the validity of existing predictions.

Another way that closeness matters is with voters themselves: as described in the Westwood (2020) reading about probabilistic forecasts, a sizeable bloc of voters are strategic, meaning that they will vote only if they believe that their vote will make a difference. Since voter turnout in the United States is quite low (according to the Pew Research Center, [only 56% in the 2016 presidential election](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/)), the electoral map could look very different if citizens who rarely vote (or have never voted) start to vote regularly in presidential or other federal-level elections. In other words, if closeness is actually a significant motivator for voters, the current two-party vote share pattern could change radically. Again, these changes would disrupt the existing models and predictions.

However, it is important to note that the data that this analysis is based upon does have a flaw: because of the Electoral College, receiving a majority of votes does not imply victory in the election. Furthermore, the popular vote percentages are not always accurate indications of closeness because electoral votes, which depend on state-level election results, are ultimately the deciding factor in determining the winner of a presidential election, *not* the popular vote. I used electoral vote data from the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/results) to calculate the percent of two-party electoral votes received by candidates for the same time period, 1948-2016. As shown below, the actual (i.e. electoral) closeness is less compelling, with multiple elections that feature very large differences between the percent of electoral votes received by each candidate.

Combining some online research with my existing knowledge, here are the contexts for the two biggest "electoral landslides" shown in the graphic. Note that in each case, the popular vote percentages are significantly closer than the electoral percentages.

**1984: Ronald Reagan vs. Walter Mondale; EV: 525-13**

In the 1984 presidential election, incumbent President Ronald Reagan attracted many traditionally Democratic voter groups, including 18-24 year-old voters, Roman Catholics, and many union households. Combining this support with his strong personal popularity, Reagan defeated Democratic nominee Walter Mondale, who had picked Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman on a major party presidential ticket, as his running mate. Additionally, at the Democratic National Convention earlier that year, Mondale had acknowledged his plan to raise taxes, providing a key contrast against Reagan, whose handling of the economy was the strongest factor that attracted voters to him. While the electoral vote was 525 to 13, the popular vote was approximately 59 to 41 percent.

**1972: Richard Nixon vs. George McGovern; EV: 520-17**

In the 1972 presidential election, incumbent President Richard Nixon promised to replace the unpopular Vietnam War draft with an all-volunteer force, and to gradually reduce the number of active U.S. troops. This weakened the impact of Democratic nominee George McGovern's main policy of immediately ending the war. Further reducing his chances of electoral success, McGovern was also plagued by the revelation that his running mate, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, had undergone shock therapy for depression. Although Nixon would soon be embroiled in the Watergate Scandal, he won 520 electoral votes and more than 60 percent of the popular vote, compared to McGovern's 17 electoral votes and 37.5 percent.

Nonetheless, even if elections aren't as close as they may appear to be, the popular vote data is still relevant. In particular, the polls and forecasts available to the general public (e.g. through the media) typically includes only popular vote percentages, not Electoral College vote projections. Intuitively, this should mean that electoral closeness simply isn't on the public's minds, implying that popular vote closeness is still important - at least when considering the impacts on voter turnout.

### State-Level Data

After showing that electoral results are considerably less close than the popular vote, I will now turn my attention to state-level data. State data is more interesting, particularly for swing states, because a candidate who wins many such states can easily achieve an electoral landslide.
