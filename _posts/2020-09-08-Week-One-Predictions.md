## Week 1 Analysis: Historical Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 11, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing historical election results from 1948 to 2016. Since all predictions are based on events that have occurred in the past, this is a good start to the blog. I will first explore the national-level results, and then analyze results from individual states over time.

### National-Level Data
To start, I will use the simplest data possible: the two-party vote share in past elections. As shown below, there is significant fluctuation over time in the vote share, between the two major parties. This suggests that presidential elections in the United States have been quite competitive in the past.  , this data does have a major limitation: due to the Electoral College system, receiving a majority of votes does not imply victory in the election. However, information about the winning party is readily available and can be easily added on.
