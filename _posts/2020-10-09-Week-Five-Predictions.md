## Week 5 Analysis: Productive Investment or Marketing Ploy? Evaluating the Role of Advertising
*Friday, October 9, 2020*

Advertising has sometimes been cited as important for a candidate's success in U.S. presidential elections. A few that I've seen prior to taking Gov 1347 include the ["Morning in America" ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/the-ad-that-helped-reagan-sell-good-times-to-an-uncertain-nation.html) (Reagan, 1984), the ["Daisy" ad](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-daisy-ad-changed-everything-about-political-advertising-180958741/) (Johnson, 1964), and the [infamous Willie Horton ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/politics/bush-willie-horton.html) (Bush, 1988). This week, I will analyze the impact of advertising on outcomes, and then add "advertising spending" as one of the predictors in my ongoing model for 2020.

## Assumptions & Theoretical Background


When including advertising as a variable in my model, **a key assumption is that there are differences between campaigns.** This is not always the case: for example, fundamentals-only models are based on the assumption that only the existence - not the activities - of a campaign matters, since campaign efforts on both sides will balance out over the course of the months leading up to the election.
