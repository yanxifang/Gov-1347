## Week 4 Analysis: The Incumbency (Dis)Advantage
*Friday, October 2, 2020*

This week, I will analyze the concept of incumbency, with a specific focus on whether changes in federal funding can affect electoral support for either the incumbent or challenger (or both) in a presidential election.

### Assumptions & Theoretical Background
The impact of government funding -- and specifically, federal-level funding -- has long been considered influential in American politics. The term "pork barrel" has been used to describe Congressionally-allocated funding targeted at a member's district or some other special interest, as described in [this article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-new-pork-barrel-whats-wrong-with-regulation-today-and-what-reformers-need-to-do-to-get-it-right/) from the Brookings Institution. However, as discussed by [Kriner and Reeves (2012)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/influence-of-federal-spending-on-presidential-elections/D7E15E901EA52BF92E5986626766224F), this "pork" can also have an impact on presidential elections, particularly in counties where the Congressional members are from the same party as an incumbent president. In addition to implying that incumbents are advantaged because of their ability to spend, this analysis suggests that there is some basis to the economy-based fundamentals approach of predicting elections, since the purpose of federal funding is to boost the local economy.

### Federal Funding: Changes at the State and Local Levels
Using the data from Kriner and Reeves (`fedgrants_bystate_1988_2018.csv`, `fedgrants_bycounty_1988_2018.xlsx`), I will attempt to replicate the analysis to determine the effect that federal funding has at the state and local (county) levels.

However, this data is only available up until 2008. This means that the 

### Does Incumbency Matter in 2020? (& The Time-for-Change Model)
**2020 is a unique year**: the COVID-19 pandemic has caused both significant disruption to the economy *and* unprecedented amounts of federal aid being disbursed. The first situation seems to indicate declining support for the incumbent, Trump, while the second seems to indicate stronger support. Do these two effects cancel each other out, or does one of the two have a greater impact on the electorate's support?

### Model Prediction
Since much of the discussion about incumbency has centered around the concept of retrospective accountability, and since federal funding is tied to voters' perception of the economy (at least at the local level), I think it's prudent to revisit my [earlier economic models](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1347/2020/09/18/Week-Two-Predictions.html) and try to incorporate incumbency as an additional variable.
