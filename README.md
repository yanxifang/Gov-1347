# Gov-1347

This blog contains my work for Government 1347 at Harvard University. The folder names should be intuitive:

* Individual weekly posts are located in the *_posts* folder.
* The data files that I've used are located in the *data* folder.
* My R scripts are located in the *scripts* folder.
* My graphics can be found in the *images* folder.
