## Testing an Election Narrative
*Thursday, December 10, 2020*

## Cindy McCain and the Democratic Victory in Arizona
**The state of Arizona has not voted for a Democrat [since Bill Clinton in 1996](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-arizona-became-a-swing-state/). Yet, it voted for Democrat Joe Biden [this year](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-mark-kelly-6841e27210770f59418bdc13a60ccec7)**, taking 11 electoral votes away from incumbent Donald Trump. The media, including [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cindy-mccain-arizona-election-biden-trump/2020/11/16/f4f29be4-2850-11eb-92b7-6ef17b3fe3b4_story.html), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/john-mccain-arizonas-gop-defeat-donald-trump-434913), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/opinions/joe-biden-flips-arizona-election-2020-talton/index.html), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/524420-former-mccain-adviser-says-biden-flipping-arizona-was-revenge-of-john), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/932091586/three-big-reasons-why-biden-is-expected-to-win-arizona), and more, have partly attributed this election upset to Cindy McCain, the widow of long-serving Republican Sen. John McCain. This year, McCain has not only taken the rare step of [speaking at the DNC](https://apnews.com/article/2ab413939e3747215da2c34dcbd323cf), but also personally [endorsed Joe Biden](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/politics/joe-biden-cindy-mccain-endorse/index.html) for the presidency, crossing party lines in a rebuke of President Trump.

**The narrative argues that Cindy McCain leveraged the late Senator McCain's popularity among both Republicans and moderates in Arizona to swing critical votes toward Biden, contributing to the Democratic victory in the state.** While McCain's defiance of the Republican Party may seem surprising, it was certainty no more unusual than the tensions between Trump and the senator. In July 2015, then-presidential candidate Trump [said](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/18/424169549/trump-lashes-out-at-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured) "I like people who weren't captured," referring to the fact that Sen. McCain was [captured  as a prisoner of war](https://time.com/5377698/john-mccain-prisoner-of-war-vietnam/) during the Vietnam War. Tensions between Trump and McCain [rose](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/08/24/mccain-trump-feud-running-list-clashes-snubs-and-conflicts/1089090002/) over the course of the 2016 election cycle, and [continued](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45313845) after became president in 2017. The divide between the two men became most evident after McCain's death in 2018, when Trump was [explicitly disinvited](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/politics/mccain-funeral-trump.html) from McCain's state funeral despite his role as the sitting president *of the same political party*.

**This narrative is important not only because McCain herself has [taken credit](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/cindy-mccain-john-mccain-pleased-biden-win-cnntv/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_source=fbCNN&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2020-11-10T09%3A30%3A22) for the victory, but also because it explains an important phenomenon that could have implications for the future: whether Arizona becoming blue is a temporary or long-term change.** If McCain's endorsement was not too significant, then one would expect Arizona to continue voting Democratic in future presidential elections. In contrast, if McCain's influence was indeed significant, then it is likely that Arizona will become red again in 2024 (assuming that Trump does not seek the presidency or is unsuccessful in becoming the Republican nominee) and beyond.

## The Role of Demographics
While McCain's influence could have been significant in persuading moderates (and Republicans alienated by Trump) to vote for Biden instead, demographics have also been cited as an important reason for the state flipping parties. For example, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/13/934591289/how-the-navajo-nation-helped-flip-arizona-for-democrats) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-flagstaff-arizona-voting-rights-fa452fbd546fa00535679d78ac40b890) cite the role of the Navajo Nation in supporting Biden, while [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/years-making-established-latino-groups-helped-biden-arizona-nevada-n1246864) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/arizona-trump-biden/2020/11/07/9f64475a-1fb7-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html) point to the growing Latinx population as a reason for Arizona becoming more blue.
