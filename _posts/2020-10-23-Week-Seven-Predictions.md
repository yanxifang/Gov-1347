## Week 7 Analysis: Shocks & The Impacts of COVID-19
*Friday, October 23, 2020*

## Intro: Why Shocks?
Many unpredictable (and often uncontrollable) things can happen in a typical year, but in a U.S. presidential election cycle, the impact of these events becomes more significant. For instance, according to [Achen and Bartels (2016), Chapter 5](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q), something as random as shark attacks can have an impact on voter choice at the polls. Although the theory behind this bizarre example is contested (see [Fowler and Hall, 2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/699244)), it does not matter so much in practice. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly impacted many Americans either economically or personally (e.g. through infection, hospitalization, or death of a family member or acquaintance), to the extent that no matter what the explanatory mechanism may be, there must be *some* impact on the outcome of the presidential election. Since COVID-19 is a negative shock from any perspective, one would expect decreased vote share for the incumbent, even if voters believe Trump could not have controlled the pandemic.

This week, I will be starting from this assumption to build a probabilistic model about potential fluctuations in voter turnout.
