## Testing an Election Narrative
*Thursday, December 10, 2020*

## The Narrative: Cindy McCain and the Democratic Victory in Arizona
The state of Arizona has not voted for a Democrat [since Bill Clinton in 1996](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-arizona-became-a-swing-state/). It voted for Democrat Joe Biden [this year](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-mark-kelly-6841e27210770f59418bdc13a60ccec7), taking 11 votes away from incumbent Donald Trump. 

## The Role of Demographics
While McCain's influence could have been significant in persuading moderates (and Republicans alienated by Trump) to vote for Biden instead, demographics have also been cited as an important reason for the state flipping parties. For example, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/13/934591289/how-the-navajo-nation-helped-flip-arizona-for-democrats) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-flagstaff-arizona-voting-rights-fa452fbd546fa00535679d78ac40b890) cite the role of the Navajo Nation in supporting Biden, while [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/years-making-established-latino-groups-helped-biden-arizona-nevada-n1246864) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/arizona-trump-biden/2020/11/07/9f64475a-1fb7-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html) point to the growing Latin population as a reason for Arizona becoming more blue.
