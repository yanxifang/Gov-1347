This week, I am analyzing historical election results from 1948 to 2016. Since all predictions are based on events that have occurred in the past, this is a good start to the blog. To begin, I will use some of the simplest data available: the two-party vote share at the national level. Although vote share is not necessarily indicative of the election outcome due to the Electoral College system, this data can be combined with actual outcomes for further analysis.
