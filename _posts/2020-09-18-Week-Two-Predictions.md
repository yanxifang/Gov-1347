## Week 2 Analysis: Economic Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 18, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing the impact of economic conditions on election results. I will mainly use GDP and unemployment data as two proxies for prevailing economic conditions at the national level, and state-level unemployment data as a proxy for more localized economic factors.

### Assumptions and Theoretical Background
**Using economic data to predict elections is rooted in the assumption of "pocketbook voting", where voters make decisions based on their evaluations of the economy.** If voters do not actually consider the economy as they enter the voting booth, this analysis wouldn't be meaningful at all. Fortunately, there is much literature about the role of the economy in U.S. presidential elections. For example, [Achen and Bartels (2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q) observe that while voters tend to respond to economic changes, the incumbent president generally has little control over the economy. Moreover, they argue that voters hold unrealistic time horizons, unreasonably discount economic performance in the earlier part of an incumbent's term, and have difficulty distinguishing the economic changes that occur between different leaders. This argument is similar to that expressed by [Healy and Lenz (2014)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24363467) about election-year economics and the potential of adversely selecting a president that is good at economic manipulation.

To test these two theories, I will analyze the relationship between short-term GDP (and unemployment) data and election outcomes, and **explore an alternate theory: that voters are concerned both about the short-term economy and their personal economic prospects.** I will use state-level unemployment data as a proxy for "personal economic prospects"; after all, if the unemployment rate in a hypothetical area is very high, it is likely that a voter or their immediate family will be impacted. Before performing the analysis, my prediction is that state-level data is a better predictor than the short-term economy as measured by either GDP or unemployment.

### National Level GDP Data
The logical place to start is with national-level GDP. GDP is [often used](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/march/what-is-gdp-why-important) as an indicator of an economy's overall size and health, and when compared to previous periods, GDP can tell whether the economy is expanding or contracting. Under the "pocketbook voting" assumption, voters will respond negatively to an incumbent seeking re-election (or a candidate from the term-limited incumbent's party) if GDP growth is poor.

I will be using **changes in second-quarter GDP** and the **national-level 2-party vote share** as the two variables in my analysis. I am using national-level vote share data because GDP is an inherently national measure. I am focusing specifically on the second-quarter of each election year because of (a) the Achen and Bartels model, (b) the value of early predictions, and (c) the unavailability of third-quarter data. First, as stated earlier, Achen and Bartels argue that voters hold unique time horizons and significantly discount the earlier economic performance of an incumbent. I agree with this assumption. According to the Pew Research Center, [only 36% of registered voters](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/) have a 4-year college degree. This means that the majority of registered voters (and thus the "average" voter) may have difficulty comprehending the many different types of economic reporting that come from the media, and it is likely that this group will remember only the latest reporting (i.e. second-quarter GDP results). Additionally, at least for 2020, second-quarter GDP data is [released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule/full) on July 30, while third-quarter data is unavailable until October 29, just a few days before the election. This means that second-quarter GDP is the most up-to-date information that is available, since last-minute forecasts are minimally useful (for example, a forecast of rainy weather is not useful if the first time you see the forecast is after you left your umbrella at home).

Below are the results of my analysis. Notably, **there is not a strong relationship between changes in second-quarter GDP and the national-level 2-party vote share**. While the p-value for the coefficient is `0.01331`, indicating statistical significance at the level of `alpha=0.05`, the r-squared value is dismal at `0.3261`. This value sparks little confidence in the model, particularly when inputting 2020 data: the model predicts that Donald Trump, as the incumbent, will receive a shockingly low `21.26%` of the two-party national vote. Furthermore, the model is questionable because of the intercept at `49.449`, which means that even if GDP were to remain stagnant, the incumbent would be expected to receive almost 49.5% of the national two-party popular vote. Given the Electoral College system in the United States, this is enough to win the presidency: just in 2016, Trump won only [46.15% of the national all-party popular vote](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/12/20/why-electoral-college-landslides-are-easier-to-win-than-popular-vote-ones/) (translating into about 48.9% the two-party vote). This implies that an incumbent who does nothing to the economy (e.g. either good or bad) can win -- a very questionable outcome. For all of these reasons, this national GDP model is unsatisfactory and should not be used independently to predict the outcome of the election.

Note: the regression equation for the graph above is:
```
(Nat'l 2-Party Vote Share) = 49.449 + 2.969 * (Change in Second-Quarter GDP)
```

### National Level Unemployment Data
I am not convinced, however, that national-level data is ineffective for predicting elections. Continuing to test the "pocketbook voting" and "short-term results" assumptions, I will now use unemployment data at the national level instead. The unemployment rate is perhaps an even more accurate indicator of economic conditions, and is certainly one that is accessible for more voters. Unemployment is more accessible because it is inherently a tangible measure: it is quite possible that a voter, someone in that voter's family, or one of the voter's friends acquaintances has experienced unemployment at some point in the past, or is experiencing unemployment now (e.g. during the election year). This is certainly true in the context of 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic wiping many jobs, particularly in the service sector and in areas that are typically reliant on travel/tourism.

For this analysis, I will be again using the **national-level 2-party vote share**, along with **three different measures of national-level unemployment: just the second quarter, an average of the first and second quarters, and the change in unemployment between the first and second quarters**. I had originally planned to use only the second-quarter data for consistency (i.e. in comparison to the GDP data), but the resulting model provided such a terrible fit that I decided to explore two more variables (each separately). The average of the first- and second-quarter unemployment level was intended to mitigate the poor fit in the first model, but this second model also proved inadequate and unsatisfactory. Finally, I decided to use the change in unemployment between the first and second quarters because of the earlier assumption that voters respond most to near-term *changes*, so I reasoned that the change in unemployment levels could be more useful than the nominal value of the unemployment rate.

**There is not a strong relationship between the national-level 2-party vote share and *any* of the three national-level unemployment variables that I tested.**
* For the second-quarter data, the generated equation was `Y = 51.88093 + 0.02271*X`, where `Y` is the national 2-party vote share and `X` is the second-quarter unemployment rate. The associated p-value was an astonishingly high `0.9789`, rendering the equation very statistically *in*significant, and the r-squared value was almost non-existent at `4.516e-05`.
* For the average of the first- and second-quarter data, the generated equation was `Y = 50.8633 + 0.2070*X`, where `Y` is the same as before and `X` is the average of the unemployment rates in the first and second quarters. Again, the equation was a very poor fit: the associated p-value was `0.812`, and the r-squared value was `0.00364`.
* For the change in the unemployment rate between the first and second quarter unemployment rates, the generated equation was `Y = 52.023 - 8.733*X`, where `Y` is the same as before and `X` is the change in unemployment between the first and second quarters (calculated as `UE(Second Quarter) - UE(First Quarter)`). The p-value is much better at `0.02631`, indicating statistical significance at the standard 0.95 confidence level, although the r-squared value is still rather poor (and is worse than the second-quarter GDP growth model) at `0.2724`.

This is the graph of the "first-to-second-quarter change in unemployment" model:

![Second-Quarter UE Change vs Two-Party Presidential Popular Vote Share (1948-2016)](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1347/images/PV_natl_delta_ue.png)

**While this equation may be statistically significant, it is minimally useful.** It predicts that an incumbent who experiences no change in the unemployment rate between the first and second quarters of the election year will automatically gain more than `52%` of the national 2-party popular vote, which is very high. It also predicts a *very* heavy penalty for an increase in the unemployment rate: a `8.733` percentage-point decrease in the popular vote share even with *just a 1% increase in national unemployment*. In the context of 2020, this model actually predicts that the incumbent will receive `-28.32116%` of the national popular vote, which is obviously impossible. Conversely, in an election year where the unemployment rate decreases significantly, this model would also predict a significant landslide for the incumbent. Thus, it is clear that this model overstates the impact of the change in unemployment between the first and second quarters, which would make sense given the low r-squared value of `0.2724`.

While both of these national-level indicators are not good predictors, I am hesitant about combining the two for multiple regression. GDP growth is often linked to unemployment data because both are indicators of prevailing economic conditions: for example, if GDP (and thus national production) is shrinking rapidly, one would expect that the economy needs less jobs than before, which would drive up unemployment levels. This issue has been addressed in a recent publication from [the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2020/04/16/how-bad-can-it-be-the-relationship-between-gdp-growth-and-the-unemployment-rate), and a link between the two variables would mean that they are not independent from each other. Without independence, the assumptions behind regression are violated.

### State Level Unemployment Data
Since the two main, measurable national-level economic indicators have not proven fruitful, I am moving on to more localized data, in the form of state-level unemployment rates. The theoretical rationale is that voters care more about their own personal wellbeing than the wellbeing of the country in general, meaning that their impact will be more noticeable when looking at information that pertains more directly to each person. The state-level unemployment data should address this need, although a limitation is that the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is only available starting in 1976, further reducing the number of samples that the regression is based upon to less than 15.

Using the same theoretical underpinnings, I will use the **average of the state-level unemployment rate in the first five months of the election year** and the **state-level two-party popular vote share** as my two variables. The state-level vote share as the dependent variable is an obvious choice, and I chose five months because this was the limit of the 2020 data that I had in my existing source, which was also from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I decided to average the data for the five months of an election year to smooth out any sudden fluctuations: at the state level, some single-employer (e.g. major auto manufacturer or energy producer) decisions about hiring and firing could have a large impact on the unemployment rate, and these decisions do not always have a connection to the prevailing economic conditions that a president can reasonably be assumed to have influence over (e.g. in the case of company mismanagement). This slightly violates the near-term assumption that I followed earlier, but it's still in the same spirit because Achen and Bartels note that voters tend to heavily discount earlier economic performance, not necessarily economic performance during election year itself.

**Again, there is not a strong relationship between the state-level unemployment and the state-level two-party popular vote share**. The resulting equation for linear regression is `Y = 48.395 + 0.361*X`, where `Y` is the state-level two-party popular vote share and `X` is the average unemployment rate over the first five months of the election year in question. The associated p-value is `0.1267` and the r-squared value is `0.004168`, making this equation neither statistically significant nor a good fit for the data. Below is the associated graph:

![5-Month Average State Unemployment Rate vs State-Level Two-Party Presidential Popular Vote Share (1976-2016)](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1347/images/PV_loc_ue.png)

Surprisingly (or perhaps not, given the virtually nonexistent r-squared value of this regression model), the equation predicts that as state-level *unemployment rates increase*, the incumbent candidate receives a *higher percentage of the state-level two-party popular vote share*. This is a red flag because it's inconsistent with human behavior: higher unemployment rates signal a worse economy to any rational person, and it does not intuitively make sense that voters would want to reward the incumbent for a worse economy. Again, I will note that the sample size has been limited due to the unavailability of data prior to 1976, so this is perhaps another reason why the fit is so poor.

### Implications & Conclusions
**The results of this analysis have challenged my assumption that the economy plays a major role in voter decisions during presidential elections.** None of my regressions have generated predictive equations that are both (a) statistically significant at the 0.95 confidence level, and (b) a close fit to the data as measured by the r-squared value. However, this does *not* suggest that the economy is an unimportant consideration: I have only used limited parts of the available GDP and unemployment data to further my understanding, and it is very possible that the parts I ruled out (e.g. due to assumptions) are actually the ones that matter.

Furthermore, economic analysis is limited because **only the first- and second-quarter GDP and unemployment rates of an election year can be used.** Although historical data is available for past election years, the current election year's third-quarter GDP will not be released until [October 29](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule), which is just a few days before the election. As previously discussed, late forecasts (which will be required if third-quarter GDP is used) are little better than no forecast at all, but at the same time, voters are likely to consider the latest available information (i.e. the third-quarter GDP) as they head into the ballot booths.

Another consideration is that **only linear regression has been used here**. There is a possibility that economic factors are related to the popular vote share in a non-linear way (e.g. exponential), which would explain the consistent poor fits found throughout this analysis.

Finally, a significant assumption in this analysis, or any economic analysis, is that **an incumbent party's non-incumbent nominee will implement similar policies as their term-limited predecessor when the party seeks a third consecutive term. This is likely to become a factor in elections beyond 2020.** While this hasn't been the case for any of the [7 times](https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/238812-is-it-that-hard-for-a-party-to-hold-the-white-house) between 1948 and 2016 when the incumbent party had the opportunity to hold office for more than two consecutive terms (or for the 2 cases - Truman in 1952 and Johnson in 1968 - where the incumbent was eligible to run for re-election but chose not to), this is likely to become a factor in the future: specifically, Donald Trump's economic policy has been unorthodox (and a more traditional Republican candidate is likely to propose substantially different policies), while elements of the Democratic Party are calling for unprecedented levels of government intervention and involvement in the economy (a significant departure from Joe Biden's more traditional proposals).
