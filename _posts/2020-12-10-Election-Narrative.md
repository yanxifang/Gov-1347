## Testing an Election Narrative
*Thursday, December 10, 2020*

## Cindy McCain and the Democratic Victory in Arizona
The state of Arizona has not voted for a Democrat [since Bill Clinton in 1996](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-arizona-became-a-swing-state/). It voted for Democrat Joe Biden [this year](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-mark-kelly-6841e27210770f59418bdc13a60ccec7), taking 11 electoral votes away from incumbent Donald Trump. The media, including [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cindy-mccain-arizona-election-biden-trump/2020/11/16/f4f29be4-2850-11eb-92b7-6ef17b3fe3b4_story.html), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/john-mccain-arizonas-gop-defeat-donald-trump-434913), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/opinions/joe-biden-flips-arizona-election-2020-talton/index.html), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/524420-former-mccain-adviser-says-biden-flipping-arizona-was-revenge-of-john), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/932091586/three-big-reasons-why-biden-is-expected-to-win-arizona), and more, have partly attributed this election upset to Cindy McCain, the widow of long-serving Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). In the 2020 election cycle, McCain has not only taken the rare step of [speaking at the DNC](https://apnews.com/article/2ab413939e3747215da2c34dcbd323cf), but also personally [endorsed Joe Biden](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/politics/joe-biden-cindy-mccain-endorse/index.html) for the presidency. The media narrative argues that because the late Senator McCain was so popular among both Republicans and moderates in Arizona, Cindy McCain's endorsement was able to sway critical votes away from Trump and toward Biden, contributing to the Democratic victory in the state.

This seemingly stunning defiance from the widow of a long-time Republican U.S. Senator has a complex background story. 

## The Role of Demographics
While McCain's influence could have been significant in persuading moderates (and Republicans alienated by Trump) to vote for Biden instead, demographics have also been cited as an important reason for the state flipping parties. For example, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/13/934591289/how-the-navajo-nation-helped-flip-arizona-for-democrats) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-flagstaff-arizona-voting-rights-fa452fbd546fa00535679d78ac40b890) cite the role of the Navajo Nation in supporting Biden, while [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/years-making-established-latino-groups-helped-biden-arizona-nevada-n1246864) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/arizona-trump-biden/2020/11/07/9f64475a-1fb7-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html) point to the growing Latin population as a reason for Arizona becoming more blue.
