## Post-Election Model Reflection
*Monday, November 23, 2020*

## Recap: Model & Predictions
Over the past few months, I've studied many of the factors that potentially affect election results, ranging from the economy to shocks, to demographics and the incumbency advantage. Along the way, I created many models looking at those factors individually, which included:

- Historical Election Results
- State of the Economy, and Other Fundamentals
- Polling Data
- Incumbency (Dis)advantage
- Air War / Media Spending
- Ground Game / Campaign Efforts
- Shocks, and the COVID-19 Pandemic
- Laws and Administration

Today, I will be putting everything together to create a single model - and one prediction - for the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
