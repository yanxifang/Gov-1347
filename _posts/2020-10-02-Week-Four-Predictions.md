## Week 4 Analysis: The Incumbency (Dis)Advantage
*Friday, October 2, 2020*

This week, I will analyze the concept of incumbency, with a specific focus on whether changes in federal funding can affect electoral support for either the incumbent or challenger (or both) in a presidential election.

### Assumptions

### Federal Funding: Changes at the State Level

### Federal Funding: Changes at the Local Level

### Does Incumbency Matter in 2020?

### Model Prediction
Since much of the discussion about incumbency has centered around the concept of retrospective accountability, and since federal funding is tied to voters' perception of the economy (at least at the local level), I think it's prudent to revisit my [earlier economic models](yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1347/2020/09/18/Week-Two-Predictions.html) and try to incorporate incumbency as an additional variable.
