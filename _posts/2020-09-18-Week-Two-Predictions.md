## Week 2 Analysis: Economic Data, 1948-2016
*Friday, September 18, 2020*

This week, I am analyzing the impact of economic conditions on election results. I will mainly use GDP and unemployment data as two proxies for prevailing economic conditions at the national level, and for a more detailed analysis, I will look at state-level unemployment data to determine if more localized economic factors have impacts on a state's choice of presidential party or candidate.

### Assumptions and Theoretical Background
**The process of analyzing economic data to predict elections is rooted in the assumption of "pocketbook voting", where voters make decisions based on their evaluations of the economy.** If voters do not actually consider the economy as they enter the voting booth, this analysis wouldn't be meaningful at all; fortunately, there are a variety of theories about the role of the economy in U.S. presidential elections. 

### National Level GDP Data

### National Level Unemployment Data

### State Level Unemployment Data

### Implications & Conclusions
